# gravitationSim
## What is it?
I had nothing to do so created a simulation of gravitation (or something that works like that)
## How to use?
1. Open https://nikitarizh.github.io/gravitationSim
2. Left click to create a body (don't forget to set its' mass and radius using the panel on the left) (radius doesn't affect anything but drawing size (for now))
3. Left click and drag to create a body and set its' speed
4. Right click to create a body and launch it into the closest body's orbit
5. Enjoy!
