# gravitationSim
## What is it?
I had nothing to do so created a simulation of gravitation (or something that works like that)
## How to use?
1. Open https://nikitarizh.github.io/gravitationSim
2. Click to create a body (don't forget to set its' mass and radius using the panel on the left) (radius doesn't affect anything but drawing size (for now))
3. Enjoy!
